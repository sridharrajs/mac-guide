There are couple of things that you need to do to the dock

1. Move the Dock to the left side of the screen. 
2. Reduce the size of the Dock

This will both optmize the screen for space and takes up consistent place like Gnome dock on Debian. 

## Finder
Copying the current directory's path to the clipboard `Option` + `Command` + `C`
