## Configuration

Following are the configuration managed externally in a different repo.

|Component| Repo |
|---------|------|
| dotfiles| [dotfiles](https://github.com/sridharrajs/dotfiles) |
| emacs | [emacs.d](https://github.com/sridharrajs/emacs.d) |

## Key mapping

You need to recognize symbols to apply shortcuts

|Symbol|Key|
|------|---|
|`⌘`| Command|
|`⌃`| Control|
|`⌥`| Options/Meta|
|`⇧`| Shift|

## Dock

First, remove **all the default and unused apps** from the dock.

There are couple of things that you need to do to the dock

1. Move the Dock to the left side of the screen. This is to be similar to that [GNOME dock on My Debian setup](https://github.com/sridharrajs/debian-guide). This way we'll be able to use the full height of the screen for web development.
2. Reduce the size of the Dock

This way I've optimized the screen for both space and attention.
